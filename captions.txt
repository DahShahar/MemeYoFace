I'm crying with my eyes.
Butterflies in my stomach.
I'm lonely.
I love caffeine!
I love coffee!
I love dank memes!
I worry. A lot.
I stress the small things.
I'm stuck judging this.
I wish I was somewhere else.
I haven't slept in days.
//I pee sitting down.
I have tinder plus.
//I'm 6ft tall on grindr.
I dry my tears with cat fur.
I'm surprised!
These captions make me uncomfortable.
I love AI!
These creators are so smart!
I had a great time at Hamp Hack!
Im speaking in public. I'm nervous.
Country music makes me mad.
I dislike Kanye.
I miss the early 2000's.
It is a great day to be alive.
I hope this works.
